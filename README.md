# git_html_css_javascript_serverside_API_weather_dashboard

## Description

The goal was to make a weather dashboard that displayed the current days temperature, wind mph, humidity, and UV index while displaying the five day forecast below. The weather dashboard needed to allow a user to look up the weather in the city of their choice through a weather API. Then a button needed to be created with that cities name so it could be easily recalled upon. Html, css, and javascript were utilized to make all of this possible. The javascript was the bulk of the work as it contained the API call and the button creation.
